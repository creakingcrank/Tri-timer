# Tri-timer
Pebble triathlon stopwatch
## Description
A stopwatch that times and stores the five splits in a triathlon (swim - transition 1 - bike - transition 2 - run), as well as the total time
## Use
* Press the DOWN button (marked with a ">" symbol) to start the timer, advance to the next split, and stop the timer at the finish. In a race, this may be the only button you need.
* Use the UP button to look through the recorded splits. If the watch is timing another split, a flashing indicator appears in the bottom left of the screen indicating the phase being timed. After ten seconds, the display returns automatically to the split currently being timed, unless the overall time is being viewed
* Use the SET button to pause or restart the timer (only really needed in the event of a problem - perhaps you have a mechanical and want to ignore the time taken to fix it). When paused "II" flashes in the bottom left corner of the display. If no timer is running, pause/restart has no effect.
* When no timer is running, hold down the SET button for 3 seconds to reset all the splits
* Timers are held in persistent storage, so you can leave the app, even with timers running, and return later if you need to.
* If you accidentally advance the timer to the wrong split, you can repeatedly press the DOWN button to roll through the timers to the correct one
